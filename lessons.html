          <h2>Lesson Plans</h2>
          <p>Every child is different – and so are our lessons! Mandi creates personalised plans based on your little one’s goals, whether that’s preparing for an exam, composing their own music, or just exploring the wonderful world of sound.</p>
        
          <p>Here’s a little peek into what our youngest pianists get up to:</p>
        
          <p>We start each session with our cheerful Hello song and a wriggly warm-up with the Wiggle Wiggle tune. At the end of every lesson, we cuddle the toys and tuck them into bed – the perfect musical wind-down.</p>
        
          <p>In between, it’s a magical mix of exploring pitch, rhythm, dynamics, tempo, and articulation – all with the help of Tucker the dog, Jessie the cat, Billy the bunny, and their musical gang! Mums, Dads, and carers are welcome to join in the fun with songs and games that make learning feel like play.</p>
        
          <p>Each child gets their very own practice book, earns stickers as they go, and celebrates milestones with certificates – because every step is worth celebrating!</p>

      <h2>Lesson Plan</h2>

      <section>
    
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 15 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Piano Exploration, Listening, and Early Musical Concepts</p>

        <p>At Piano Pals, we understand that every child develops at their own pace. Some little ones dive straight in, while others take a little longer to warm up — and that’s perfectly okay.</p>
  
        <p>Lessons are always tailored to suit each child’s personality, mood, and stage of development. Whether your child is confident and curious, or quiet and observant, we gently adapt the approach to help them feel comfortable, engaged, and happy at the piano.</p>
        
        <p>Our goal is to nurture a love of music that grows with them — with no pressure, just plenty of encouragement, play, and discovery along the way. Here's an example lesson plan: </p>
      
        <h3>1. Welcome Song at the Piano (2 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Begin with a short hello song, sung while sitting at the piano. Use simple patterns on the high and low keys to introduce pitch contrast. Encourage the child to sing along and tap a few keys as part of the greeting.</p>
      
        <h3>2. High and Low Sound Game (3 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Introduce the concept of high and low sounds. Play notes at either end of the keyboard and ask, “Is this a high sound or a low sound?” Let the child try playing both ends themselves. Add body movement — stretch up for high, crouch down for low.</p>
      
        <h3>3. Finger Play & Key Discovery (4 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Guide the child in exploring the black and white keys. Encourage them to use individual fingers (start with index and middle fingers) to press gently. Look for groups of 2 and 3 black keys, and name them in a fun, game-like way.</p>
      
        <h3>4. Copycat Rhythms (3 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Play simple rhythms on one or two keys (e.g. long-short-short), and encourage the child to copy. Keep it fun and very simple, using verbal cues like “tap-tap-tap!” or “slow – quick-quick!” to match the rhythm.</p>
      
        <h3>5. Goodbye Song (3 minutes)</h3>
        <p>End with a calming goodbye song at the piano. Use a few familiar notes or chords and sing a gentle farewell. Encourage the child to play a note or two along with the final lines, reinforcing a positive, musical goodbye.</p>

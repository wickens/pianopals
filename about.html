          <h2>About Mandi</h2>
          <p>Mandi is a qualified music teacher with experience teaching children and adults of all ages. Mandi believes
            that music is the greatest way you can build confidence and self-esteem, express your emotions creatively,
            learn fine motor skills and develop your musical ear.</p>

          <p>She loves to teach under 5s with a gentle, encouraging approach focusing on play and exploration of sound,
            taking their first steps in music. Mandi is happy to support children and adults through exams with a focus
            on ABRSM for piano. Knowing that every learner is different, the lessons are tailored to suit everyone’s
            personality, pace and interests.</p>

          <p>Mandi has played piano and sung for many years, achieving her grade 8 in Rock School vocals, a distinction
            with music theory, a first class degree in Music Technology and loves to compose, mix and master her music.
          </p>

          <p>At the heart of it all is Mandi’s deep love of teaching — and a genuine delight in watching learners grow
            through music. Her goal is not just to teach notes and songs, but to nurture curiosity, confidence, and a
            lifelong love of making music.</p>

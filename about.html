        <h2>About Mandi Wickens</h2>

        <p>Mandi is a qualified music teacher with years of experience teaching children of all ages, including up to
          secondary level. However, her greatest joy comes from working with the youngest learners — helping little ones
          take their very first steps into the world of music. Her gentle, encouraging approach is perfectly suited to
          under-5s, creating a warm and playful atmosphere where children feel safe to explore, express themselves, and
          have fun.</p>

        <p>As a confident pianist, singer, and guitar player, Mandi brings a wide range of musical skills into each
          lesson, giving children a rich and varied introduction to sound and rhythm. Whether they’re tapping along to
          the beat, singing their favourite songs, or discovering the keys of the piano, every moment is designed to
          spark joy and build confidence.</p>

        <p>Mandi also holds an advanced degree in music technology, which allows her to blend traditional instruments
          with creative tools that engage young imaginations. She understands that every child is different, and she
          tailors her teaching to suit each child’s personality, pace, and interests.</p>

        <p>At the heart of it all is Mandi’s deep love of teaching — and a genuine delight in watching children grow
          through music. Her goal is not just to teach notes and songs, but to nurture curiosity, confidence, and a
          lifelong love of making music.</p>
